To create a fake news detection algorithm,a series of python script are run to get the necessary information.Firstly, a script called "SCRAPPER" is run to get the url,domain and hyperlinked text within the supplied webpage.Then the various links are compared with a static database of known fake news sites ,which is stored in a CSV(comma separated values)format.The database file was obtained from OpenSources.co ,and was modified to support more sites(particularly Indian sites).All this is run from GUI made in python using TkInter.
